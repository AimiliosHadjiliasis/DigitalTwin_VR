A comment on a frequently asked subject:

If you see “Pink Object” you are probably using HDRP or the Lightweight Render Pipeline.
To use HDRP / Lightweight you have to update you Materials:

Edit (Top Bar) > Render Pipeline > Upgrade Project Materials to HDRP-Materials [Or Upgrade Project Materials to Lightweight-Materials]
